## RStudio 

We'll be doing all of our work in RStudio, an integrated development environment that is intended to make working with the language easier. The purpose of this workshop is to spend some time getting familiar with RStudio and R and explore different elements of both the language and the user interface of RStudio.

## R Basics

1. See if you can have R add 2 plus 2. 

```{r}

```

2. Try to calculate the square root of 10 (hint: try typing `?sqrt` into the console.)

```{r}

```

3. What is the result of 2 times pi? 

```{r}

```

4. RStudio includes lots of documentation. See if you can locate the "An Introduction to R" section of the R Resources guide using the Help pane in RStudio.

### Variable assignment

R lets us assign variables to values, datasets, and even functions. This lets us store information that we can access again and again as we do our work. In R, this is done through the arrow operator `<-` -- anything on the right-hand side of the arrow will be assigned the name provided on the left-hand side. 

```{r}
x <- 10
x
```

```{r}
root_10 <- sqrt(10)
root_10
```

Names of variables should start with a letter and typically be descriptive so you can keep track of variables as you work with them. Anytime to you need to see what's in the variable, you can type the name of the variable in the console or mouse click the name of the variable in the Environment pane in RStudio.

We can read several data modes and structures in R, and we can check our environment variables at any time to see what those are. R typically recognizes **numeric**, **character**, and **logical** data types. Try the following: 

```{r}
is.numeric(x)
```

```{r}
name <- "Jane"

# numeric? 
is.numeric(name)
```

```{r}
# character?
is.character(name)
```

```{r}
# R can tell us data types. 

# What is x?
class(x)

# What is name?
class(name)
```

R also recognizes matrices, arrays, and lists; consult the [exercises](https://jasonheppler.org/courses/bootcampr.2020/exercises/02-exercises/) for more information on these.

### Help!

R contains a lot of included documentation, and you can ask for help at any time in RStudio. You can do this through the `help()` function or the `?` shortcut. You can ask for help on functions or packages. 

```{r}
help(help) # or, ?help
```

**Exercise**: How would you find help on using the `str()` function?

```{r}

```

### Reading data into R 

Occassionally we can load in datasets that are built-in to R by default or are available through R packages. For example, you can use the `mtcars` library to load in a dataset vehicle fuel consumption and automobile design. 

```{r}
data(mtcars) # type ?data in your console to see what this does
mtcars
```

R also has several default ways of reading in files from comma-separated files, tab-separated files, fix width files, table formats, or other elimited files. There are a few functions available in R to get data in, including `read.csv`, `read.delim()`, `read.fwf()`, `read.table()`, and others. When you read data into R, you'll assign the dataset to a variable.

```{r}
data <- read.csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/unolibraries/workshops/master/bootcampr/data/babyNames.csv")

# Look at the top ten rows
head(data)
```

Be aware that Base R's `read.csv()` will often read in categorical data as [factors](https://www.stat.berkeley.edu/~s133/factors.html), which you typically won't want. You may need to pass an argument to `read.csv()` to prevent that, using `read.csv(data, stringsAsFactors = FALSE)`.

We can double-check the structure of our dataset using R's `str()` function, which tells us how R is interpreting columns. See this section's [exercises](https://jasonheppler.org/courses/bootcampr.2020/exercises/02-exercises/) for more information.

```{r}
str(data)
```

## Subsetting data

We're going to compare approaches to Base R and Tidyverse methods in the next workshop, but for now let's dig into how Base R handles this. To make this a little more clear, let's rename `data` to `babynames`. 

```{r}
babynames <- data

# We can look at the top five rows
head(babynames)
```

**Exercise**: How would you list out more than the top five items of the dataframe using head()? (Hint: check ?head)

```{r}

```

First, let's say we want to filter out names of babies born in a specific year. In Base R, we can achieve that through a method called **subsetting**. R has powerful ways for us to subset object elements, and we can do a variety of things to access the information. In Base R, if we want to locate all baby names used in 1990 one way of achieving that would be: 

```{r}
babynames_subset <- babynames[which(babynames$Year==1990), ]
babynames_subset
```

There's a lot going on here, so let's break it down. 

1. First things first, we are telling R which dataset we are using (`babynames`) and we use the `[` and `]` brackets to access the index of the data frame. We refer to the brackets as an **index operator**.
2. Next, we pass along the `which()` function, which is a logical function that returns TRUE or FALSE for a given argument. Anything that returns TRUE is returned back to us. 
3. We have to tell the dataset which column we're intereseted in looking at. The dollar sign in `babynames$Year` lets us grab an individual column by name. Go ahead and, in your console, type `babynames$` and hit Tab -- you should be returned a list of the column names. 
4. We then use a **comma** following the `which()` function, which tells R to return *rows* from the data frame. If we placed the comma in front of the `which()` function, we'd be telling R to return *columns* as a data frame.
5. Finally, we close the notation with the right bracket and assign the returned data to `babynames_subset`.

We can make this a little easier using the `subset()` function, which means you won't need to use the Base R notations to access the index. 

```{r}
babynames_subset2 <- subset(babynames, Year == 1990)
babynames_subset2
```

We can also grab a range of columns, or specific columns as we need.

```{r}
# We only want the Name and Year columns
babynames[c("Name","Year")]
```

We can also grab a range of observations using the range operator (`:`). If we want the first three rows in our dataframe, we can achieve that like this: 

```{r}
babynames[1:3,]
```

**Exercise**: How would you select the rows thirty through fifty? 

```{r}

```

**Exercise**: How would you grab the first thirty observations and first three variables?

```{r}

```

We can also pass in conditionals to these functions, but we have to include the `which()` function to do so. Let's grab all names between 1989 and 1996: 

```{r}
# What does which() do? See ?which
babynames[which(babynames$Sex == "Girls" & babynames$Year > 1989),]
```

Note, also, that in order for the code above to work **we must include which dataframe we are calling to** -- we cannot just include the column name alone (e.g., babynames$Year). Asking R to find these column names without first telling it which dataframe to use will result in an error.

**Exercise**: Can you find the names of babies born in 1998? (Hint: remember the difference between `=` and `==`.)

```{r}

```

**Exercise**: Use `subset()` to extract data about your name (or another name of your choice).

```{r}

```

**Exercise**: (optional) Look up how to use the sample() and nrow() functions. How would you generate a random sample of data from the babynames data frame?

```{r}

```

### Creating new columns of data

We have ways that we can create additional columns of data in our data frame as well. Let's imagine we want to measure the popularity of a name. We could do this through proportion so we don't confound popularity with the number of babies born in a year. In Base R, we can use the dollar sign notation to create new columns based on existing data. We simply pass the new column name as if it were a variable. 

```{r}
babynames$logCount <- babynames$Count / 1000
head(babynames)
```

**Exercise**: Can you create a column that uses the `log()` function instead of dividing by 1000? (Make sure to give your new column name a different name from logCount.)

```{r}

```

### Summarizing data 

R has a variety of ways to collapse data into single statistical summaries. One example of this is R's built-in `summary()` function, which compues min, max, mean, median, and quartiles. 

```{r}
summary(babynames)
```

**Exercise**: Use `summary()` and subsetting to grab the summary of babynames data from the year 1999. 

```{r}

```

## Descriptive statistics

As a language designed for statistics, R comes with a variety of built-in descriptive statistics. Here's a few to check out: 

```{r}
data(trees)
median(trees$Girth)
var(trees$Girth) # variance
sd(trees$Girth) # standard deviation
max(trees$Girth) # max value
min(trees$Girth) # min value
range(trees$Girth) # range
quantile(trees$Girth) # quantiles 25%
fivenum(trees$Girth) # box plot elements
length(trees$Girth) # number of observations for a variable
length(trees) # number of observations for a dataset
```

## Saving our work

Such like reading in datasets, we can easily write out data as well. Like before, Base R comes with a few of its own writing functions which are (you've probably already guessed) `write.csv`, `write.table`, and a few others. The Tidyverse also comes with its own write functions, including `write_csv`, `write_table`, among others. 

If we want to save the work we've done to our babynames data set, we can simply write: 

```{r}
write.csv(babynames, file = "~/Desktop/babynames.csv")
```
